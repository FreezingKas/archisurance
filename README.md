# ArchiSurance

The [ArchiSurance Case Study](https://www2.opengroup.org/ogsys/catalog/Y163) is a fictitious example developed to illustrate the use of the ArchiMate® modeling language in the context of the TOGAF® framework. The Case Study concerns the insurance company ArchiSurance, which has been formed as the result of a merger of three previously independent companies. The Case Study describes the baseline architecture of the company and then a number of change scenarios.
